    <h2>Indemnity.</h2>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>Claims of Copyright Infringement.</h2>

    <p>
      The Digital
      Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for
      copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet
      infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law.  If you believe in good
      faith that materials available on the Site infringe your copyright, you (or
      your agent) may send DCREH a notice requesting that we remove the material
      or block access to it.  If you believe, in good faith, that someone has
      wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA
      permits you to send DCREH a counter-notice.  Notices and counter-notices
      must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See
      http://www.copyright.gov for details.  Notices and counter-notices should be
      sent to: Designated Agent (Phone: 650-352-8851), PO Box 10195, Dept 1173,
      Palo Alto CA 94303; or by email to legal@emersoncollective.com.
    </p>

    <h2>General Terms.</h2>

    <p>
      You agree that no joint venture, partnership,
      employment or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of
      the Terms or your use of the Site.  The Terms constitute the entire
      agreement between you and Emerson with respect to your use of the Site.  The
      failure of DCREH to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms
      shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  If any provision
      of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
      the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect
      to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other
      provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.  The Terms and the
      relationship between you and DCREH shall be governed by the laws of the
      State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions.  A
      printed version of the Terms and of any notice given in electronic form
      shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or
      relating to the Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions
      as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained
      in printed form. Section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and
      have no legal or contractual effect. Any rights not expressly granted herein
      are reserved.
